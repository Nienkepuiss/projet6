# Mon vieux grimoire : back-end

This project was completed as part of the Web Developper training program at [OpenClassrooms](https://openclassrooms.com/fr/paths/899-developpeur-web).

> Implement the back-end of a book rating website ðŸ“šâ˜… <br>
> Set up the server structure and manage the communication between the server and the database ðŸ’»

### Technical constraints :

-   Security :
    -   The user's password must be hashed.
    -   Authentication must be enforced on all required book routes.
    -   Email addresses in the database must be unique, and an appropriate Mongoose plugin should be used to ensure their uniqueness and report errors.
    -   The security of the MongoDB database (from a service such as MongoDB Atlas) should not prevent the application from launching on a user's machine.
    -   Errors from the database must be reported.
      
    -   Images uploaded by users need to be optimized to ensure the project adheres to green code best practices.
